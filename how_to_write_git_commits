git commit -m "$(fortune)"

https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/
  - fix: commits, trim long messages to 72
  - feat: issues, add option to filter by reviewer
  - fix: notifications, actually mark as read when dismissing 
  - chore: foolib, upgrade to 1.2.3
  - perf: comments, index on author makes search 2x faster

Alternative:
  - Type can be 
  - feat     (new feature)
  - fix      (bug fix)
  - refactor (refactoring production code)
  - style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
  - docs     (changes to documentation)
  - test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
  - chore    (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
